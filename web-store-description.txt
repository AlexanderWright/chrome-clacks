To quote the twitter account of the great man himself:
"AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER."
Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night.

A big thank you to all of the lovely people who sent new icons (listed above)!

The Chrome Developer Dashboard sucks and doesn't notify me of feedback - I try to keep an eye on it but if I don't reply, email me (devpete0@gmail.com). I have never written a browser extension before and have no idea if this one could be optimised or if it will slow your browser down appreciably. I take no responsibility for that but am completely open to suggestions on improvements.

I don't know anything about licences so I'm including one offered by Github just in case because it seems pretty reasonable. This is a simple extension and a tribute to Terry so I'm not really worried what you do with it.


Note 1: There are people complaining about the new permissions required by the latest update. That's fair enough, I would be too. The latest updates need 'webNavigation' permissions for reading the HTML meta tags (a feature which a lot of people were asking for). That is what requires access to web page content. The original permissions required by older versions were for webRequest, which is necessary for the basic HTTP header interception. As far as I know, there isn't a better way of doing it. If you are still concerned I suggest downloading it directly from Github (link below) so you know exactly what you are getting, you just won't get automatic updates. I wish there was a way to transparently publish directly from the public version on Github but as far as I know, the only way is to upload zip files myself. There is no way I can guarantee I haven't changed anything in between.
