To quote the twitter account of the great man himself:
"AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER."
Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black
desert under the endless night.

I have never written a browser extension before and have no idea if this one
could be optimised or if it will slow your browser down appreciably. I take no
responsibility for that but am completely open to suggestions on improvements.

I don't know anything about licences so I'm including one offered by Github just
in case because it seems pretty reasonable. This is a simple extension and a
tribute to Terry so I'm not really worried what you do with it.
